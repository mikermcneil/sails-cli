# sails-cli

Experimental standalone CLI for Sails.  Not ready for use yet.


### What is this?

The purpose of this package is to provide a standalone CLI package for Sails.  This may or may not be the approach we eventually take, but this repo is here as an exploratory beginning.


### Can I help?

Not really, yet.  See https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/3137#issuecomment-172288628 for where this fits into priorities for Sails core.  If you have any ideas in the mean time, please feel free to open a proposal using the process outlined [here](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#v-proposing-features-and-enhancements).  Thanks!
